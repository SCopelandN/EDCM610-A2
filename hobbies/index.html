<h1> Crafting </h1>
   <details>
       <summary> The one that makes me money! </summary>
          <p> Crafting makes me money. I am a hands-on person and I love to craft. I have done things like making wedding and birthday cards (paper not digital), decorating graduation caps, making wreaths, making props and table centerpieces for weddings and baby showers. Crafting is a project where you make things by hand and usually when I do this hobby, I am making money! </p>

   <h1> Sports </h1>
   <details>
     <summary> The one that keeps me active! </summary>
     <p> This is the hobby that keeps me active. I love sports, watching them and playing them. Some of my favorite sports are basketball, football, softball, track and field and swimming. Playing a sport is a great workout for the body because it helps your breathing while working your muscles. Playing sports also improves your endurance, strength, stamina and helps build lean muscles. For me participating is sports is more engaging and exciting than being in a gym. </p>

   <h1> Polymer Clay </h1>
   <details>
     <summary> The one that keeps me creative! </summary>
     <p>This hobby allows me to stay creative. The creation possibilities are endless when working with it. Polymer clay is a type of modeling clay that is made from vinyl. I love polymer clay because it stays soft until you bake it in an oven. Unlike air dry clay, it won’t dry out so you can keep the leftovers to use for another time. It is versatile and you can blend it to create custom colors. You can also sculpt it, stamp it, emboss textures on it and even paint it. Polymer clay is used to make a variety of things but my favorite is earrings.
